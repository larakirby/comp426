        <h1>THE LEVIATHAN</h1>
        <h2 id='headers'>Introduction and Significance in Scripture:</h2>
        <h3>The Leviathan is a sea serpet from Hebrew scripture, with its name loosely meaning "twisted in folds". The creature as it appears in the Book of Job is similar to Lotan, a primevial sea monster that was the servant of the sea god Yam. Some scriptures cites this monster as 300 miles in length with luminous eyes.
                In scripture, the Leviathan is one of the earliest creations of God. Interestingly, there is some 
                speculation that the Leviathan was later adopted into Christianity to effectively scare people into converting
                in order to have protection from the Leviathan from the Christian God.
                The Leviathan, as a primordial being, had control over the earth, while the bull Behemoth ruled the land and the dragon Ziz ruled the sky.
                However, the Leviathan was regarded as the most dangerous of the three as well as the only malicious primordial being that would cause harm to people.
