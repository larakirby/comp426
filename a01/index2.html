            <h1>THE LEVIATHAN</h1>
            <h2>Modern Significance:</h2>
            <h4>"Leviathan" is a word used in many instances in modern culture and pop culture alike. 
                People in positions of power are often referred to as "Leviathans" of their field,
                and "Leviathan" can be used to refer to any imposing sea creature, not just the scriptural Leviathan.
                Additionally, though "Leviathan" originated from Hebrew scripture, the word "Leviathan" in modern
                Hebrew refers to a whale.</h4>
